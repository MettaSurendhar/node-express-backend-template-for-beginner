# Routes 🌐

## What are Routes? 🤔

Routes define how your API responds to different HTTP requests. They determine how the application should handle incoming requests, including which code to run and what response to send back to the client.

### Purpose 🎯

This folder contains the route definitions for your API, which:

- **Determine Request Handling:** Specify how to process different types of requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Define Endpoints:** Set the paths for various API endpoints (e.g., `/users`, `/products`).

### Structure 🗂️

The folder contains route files that:

- **Define Endpoints:** Each file corresponds to a specific API endpoint.
- **Specify HTTP Methods:** Indicate which methods (GET, POST, etc.) the endpoint supports.
- **Set Up Handlers:** Include the functions that process requests and send responses.

### Content Overview 📚

Each route file includes:

- **HTTP Method:** What type of request the endpoint handles (e.g., GET to retrieve data).
- **Endpoint Path:** The URL path for the endpoint (e.g., `/users` to manage user data).
- **Handler Function:** The code that runs when a request hits this endpoint (e.g., querying the database and returning results).

### Importance 🔑

Routes are crucial for defining how your API works. A well-organized route structure ensures that:

- **API is Easy to Maintain:** Clear and consistent routing makes it easier to manage and update.
- **Scalability:** New features and endpoints can be added without disrupting existing functionality.
- **Readability:** Helps developers understand and navigate the API more easily.
