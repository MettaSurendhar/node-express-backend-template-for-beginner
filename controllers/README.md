# Controllers 📋

## Controllers - Business Logic Functions 🧠

### Purpose 🎯

This folder contains the business logic functions that handle incoming requests and send responses to the client. These functions form the core of your application’s API, deciding how to process data and interact with other parts of the system.

### Structure 🗂️

- **Each controller file** corresponds to a specific API endpoint or resource. For example, a file might handle operations related to users, products, or orders.
- **Functions within each controller** are responsible for:
  - **Processing requests:** Receiving data from client requests.
  - **Executing business logic:** Performing operations like querying a database or processing data.
  - **Sending responses:** Sending the results back to the client in a suitable format (e.g., JSON).

### Example 📦

- **`userController.js`:** Handles user-related requests such as creating, updating, or deleting users.
- **`productController.js`:** Manages product-related requests like retrieving product details or updating inventory.

Feel free to explore and modify the controller files to fit your application’s needs! 🔍
